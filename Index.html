    <h1>Welcome to MY PortfolioðŸ’¼</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I'm currently working on a college portfolio project that showcases my skills and accomplishments. I earned an Associate Degree in Applied Science, and Iâ€™m really good at programming, especially in languages like Python and Java. Iâ€™ve learned a lot from my classes and have had a lot of hands-on experience, so Iâ€™m really good at solving problems and using my knowledge in real-world situations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I like to design my projects in a clean, professional, and minimalist way. I focus on making sure theyâ€™re easy to use and look good. I pay a lot of attention to detail, so my projects are always well-structured and visually appealing. I also add interactive elements to make them more engaging.</p>
